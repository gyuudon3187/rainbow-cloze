# Rainbow Cloze
Rainbow Cloze is an Anki add-on for connecting cloze deletions and corresponding translations by color. 

## How To Use
To apply this add-on to a flashcard, the card must have the following:

1. Text containing cloze deletions within the flashcard's front
2. A translation of the text in the first bullet point. It may be located in either the front or the back of the flashcard.

Once the above criteria are met, select text in the translation and press `CTRL + 1â€”9` to change both the text of the cloze deletion which ID corresponds to the pressed number, and the translation text into the same color.

## Examples
**Translation in Front**

`CTRL+1`, `CTRL+2` and `CTRL+3` are pressed when the translation is located in the flashcard front.

**Translation in Back**

`CTRL+1`, `CTRL+2` and `CTRL+3` are pressed when the translation is located in the flashcard back.
